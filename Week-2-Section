## EDA

- Critical process of initial investigations to understand data

- Effective modeling only possible with knowledge of data (aka – Domain Knowledge)

- EDA is an open-ended process – different for each person

- Data Summary and Data Visualization are powerful EDA tools

## Practice Code

Necessary Packages

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
data(flights)
```

## Data Manipulation

Before we begin working with the data, don’t forget to do `?flights` to learn about the different variables in the dataset.

How many flights were there in July?
```{r}
sum(flights$month == 7)
```
```{r}
flights %>% filter(month == 7) %>% summarise(count=n())
```

How many flights were there on my birthday, July 2nd?
```{r}
jul.2.flights <- flights %>% filter(month == 7, day == 2)
```

Find the mean and standard deviation of the amount of time spent in the air.
```{r}
mean(flights$air_time, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(flights$air_time, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r}
flights %>% summarise(Mean=mean(air_time, na.rm=TRUE), SD = sd(air_time, na.rm=TRUE))
```

How many flights have carrier as UA?
```{r}
sum(flights$carrier == "UA")
```

What is the average departure delay when the destination is HOU?
```{r}
mean(flights$dep_delay[flights$dest == "HOU"], na.rm=TRUE)
```

Which destination has the highest average departure delay?
```{r}
flights %>% group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarise(Mean = mean(dep_delay, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(Mean)) %>% 
  top_n(3)
```

What is the usual name (as per the `airports` dataset) for the destination with the highest average departure delay?



Which origin has the highest number of flights?
```{r}
table(flights$origin)
```


## Graphing Data

We have learned about various types of plots, but it is important that we understand when each type of plot is appropriate for our data.

What type of graphs are appropriate for categorical variables?

Histograms, bargraphs, boxplots

What types of graphs are appropriate for quantitative variables?
Scatterplots


A particular characteristic that we look for in graphs in skewness. Determine the relationship between the mean and median for each option below.

Right/positive skew: 
Left/negative skew: 
Symmetric: They're about the same

Now, let’s practice graphing!


Which origin airport has the greatest outlier on a boxplot for departure delay?
```{r}
flights %>% filter(dep_delay < 25) %>% ggplot(aes(x=origin, y=dep_delay)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(y = "Departure Delay", x = "Origin NYC Airport") + 
  ggtitle("Departure Delay by Origin Airport")
```

Use a histogram to determine if there is skewness in the amount of time spent in the air.
```{r}
flights %>% ggplot(aes(x=air_time)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, binwidth = 20, color = "black")
```

Examine the relationship between the amount of time spent in the air and the distance between airports, graphically.

```{r}
flights %>% ggplot(aes(x=air_time, y=distance, color=origin)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Air Time", y = "Distance between Airports") + 
  ggtitle("Amount of air time vs Distance between airports") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```


Miscellaneous questions after lecture code
```{r}
data = flights %>% select(air_time, distance)
cor(na.omit(data))
```
