### Question 1
A simple random sample of 100 observations was taken from a large population. The sample mean and the standard deviation were determined to be 80 and 14 respectively. The standard error of the mean is
```{r}
sample_mean <- 80
sample_sd <- 14
sample_size <- 100
sem <- sample_sd / sqrt(sample_size)
print(sem)
```

### Question 2
If two independent large samples are taken from two different populations, the sampling distribution of the difference between the two sample means:
* will have a variance of one
* will have a mean of approximately zero
* can be approximated by a Exponential distribution
* can be approximated by a normal distribution (CORRECT)

### Question 3
The purpose of statistical inference is to provide information about the
* mean of the sample based upon the mean of the population
* population based upon information contained in the sample (CORRECT)
* sample based upon information contained in the population
* population based upon information contained in the population

### Question 4
If a hypothesis is not rejected at the 5% level of significance, it
* must be rejected at the 10% level
* will sometimes be rejected at the 1% level
* will also not be rejected at the 1% level (CORRECT)
* will always be rejected at the 1% level

### Question 5
In a sample of 400 voters, 360 indicated they favor the incumbent governor. The 95% confidence interval of voters not favoring the incumbent is
```{r}
p <- 40 / 400
n <- 400
confidence_level <- 0.95
z <- qnorm(1 - (1 - confidence_level) / 2)
confidence_interval <- p + c(-1, 1) * z * sqrt(p * (1 - p) / n)
print(confidence_interval)
```

### Question 6
The degrees of freedom for a contingency table with 12 rows and 12 columns is
df = (c -1) x (r - 1)
df = (12 - 1 ) x (12 - 1)
```{r}
11*11
```

### Question 7 
As the number of degrees of freedom for a t distribution increases, the difference between the t distribution and the standard normal distribution
* stays the same
* None of the alternatives are correct
* becomes larger
* becomes smaller (CORRECT)

### Question 8 
In hypothesis testing, the null hypothesis can be rejected with 100% confidence level.
ANSWER: False

### Question 9 
When the level of confidence decreases, the margin of error
* shows more variability
* becomes smaller (CORRECT)
* becomes larger
* stays the same

### Question 10 
When developing an interval estimate for the difference between two sample means, with sample sizes of n1 and n2,
* n1 and n2 can be of different sizes. (CORRECT)
* n1 must be equal to n2
* n1 must be larger than n2
* n1 must be smaller than n2

### Question 11
The following random sample from a population whose values were normally distributed was collected: 10, 8, 11 and 11.
The 95% confidence interval for population mean is
```{r}
# Set the sample mean and sample standard deviation
q11 <- c(10, 8, 11, 11)
sample_mean <- mean(q11)
sample_sd <- sd(q11)
sample_size <- length(q11)
z <- qt(p = .025, df = 3)
se <- sample_sd / sqrt(sample_size)
confidence_interval = sample_mean + c(-1, 1) * z * se
print(confidence_interval)
```

### Question 12
In order to determine an interval for the mean of a population with unknown standard deviation a sample of 81 items is selected. The mean of the sample is determined to be 23. The number of degrees of freedom for reading the t value is
```{r}
sample_size <- 81
df <- sample_size - 1
print(df)
```

### Question 13
If we are interested in testing whether the proportion of items in population 1 is larger than the proportion of items in population 2, the
* null hypothesis should state P1 - P2 > 0
* alternative hypothesis should state P1 - P2 > 0 (CORRECT)
* alternative hypothesis should state P1 - P2 < 0
* null hypothesis should state P1 - P2 < 0

### Question 14
From a population with a variance of 900, a sample of 225 items is selected. At 95% confidence, the margin of error is
```{r}
population_variance <- 900
sample_size <- 225
confidence_level <- 0.95
df <- sample_size - 1
t_score <- qt(1 - (1 - confidence_level) / 2, df)
margin_of_error <- t_score * sqrt(population_variance / sample_size)
print(margin_of_error)
```

### Question 15 
Salary information regarding male and female employees of a large company is shown below.
________|Male | Female
________|________|________
Sample size | 64 | 36
Mean salary (in $1000) | 44 | 41
Population variance | 128 | 72
The 95% confidence interval for the difference between the means of the two populations is
```{r}
# Set the sample means, population variances, and sample sizes
sample_mean_male <- 44
sample_mean_female <- 41
population_variance_male <- 128
sample_size_male <- 64
population_variance_female <- 72
sample_size_female <- 36

# Set the confidence level and corresponding t-score
confidence_level <- 0.95
df <- sample_size_male + sample_size_female - 2
t_score <- qt(1 - (1 - confidence_level) / 2, df)

# Calculate the point estimate
point_estimate <- sample_mean_male - sample_mean_female

# Calculate the standard error of the point estimate
se <- sqrt(population_variance_male / sample_size_male + population_variance_female / sample_size_female)

# Calculate the confidence interval
confidence_interval = point_estimate + c(-1, 1) * t_score * se

# Print the result
print(confidence_interval)
```

### Question 16 
A random sample of 121 automobiles traveling on an interstate showed an average speed of 65 mph and standard deviation of 22 mph. The standard error of the mean is
```{r}
# Set the sample mean and standard deviation
sample_mean <- 65
sample_sd <- 22
sample_size <- 121

# Calculate the standard error of the mean
sem <- sample_sd / sqrt(sample_size)

# Print the result
print(sem)
```

### Question 17 
After computing a confidence interval, the user believes the results are meaningless because the width of the interval is too large. Which one of the following is the best recommendation?
* Decrease the sample size.
* Reduce the population variance.
* Increase the level of confidence for the interval.
* Increase the sample size. (CORRECT)

### Question 18 
Salary information regarding male and female employees of a large company is shown below.
________|Male | Female
________|________|________
Sample size |64 | 36
Mean salary (in $1000) | 44 | 41
Population variance | 128 | 72
At 95% confidence, the conclusion is the
```{r}
# Set the sample means, population variances, and sample sizes
sample_mean_male <- 44
sample_mean_female <- 41
population_variance_male <- 128
sample_size_male <- 64
population_variance_female <- 72
sample_size_female <- 36

# Set the confidence level and corresponding t-score
confidence_level <- 0.95
df <- sample_size_male + sample_size_female - 2
t_score <- qt(1 - (1 - confidence_level) / 2, df)

# Calculate the point estimate
point_estimate <- sample_mean_male - sample_mean_female

# Calculate the standard error of the point estimate
se <- sqrt(population_variance_male / sample_size_male + population_variance_female / sample_size_female)

# Calculate the confidence interval
confidence_interval = point_estimate + c(-1, 1) * t_score * se

# Check if the confidence interval contains 0
if (0 %in% confidence_interval) {
  conclusion <- "salaries of males and females are equal"
} else if (point_estimate > 0) {
  conclusion <- "average salary of males is significantly greater than females"
} else {
  conclusion <- "average salary of males is significantly lower than females"
}

# Print the result
print(conclusion)
```
* average salary of males is significantly greater than females
* salaries of males and females are equal
* average salary of males is significantly lower than females
* None of these alternatives is correct. (CORRECT)

### Questiom 19 
The starting salaries of individuals with an MBA degree are normally distributed with a mean of $40,000 and a standard deviation of $5,000. What is the probability that a randomly selected individual with an MBA degree will get a starting salary of at least $47,500?
```{r} 
# Set the mean and standard deviation
mean_salary <- 40000
sd_salary <- 5000

# Calculate the probability
prob <- pnorm(47500, mean = mean_salary, sd = sd_salary, lower.tail = FALSE)

# Print the result
print(prob)
