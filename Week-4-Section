```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r}
employees <- read.csv('employees3 (1).csv')
plot(employees$educ, employees$salary, xlab="Experience", ylab="Salary")
```
b) Find the correlation coefficient.What does it tell you? Is it appropriate, compared to the scatterplot?


```{r}
cor(employees$educ, employees$salary)
```

The correlation coefficient is 0.6541164 which indicates a medium substantial relationship between experience and salary. It seems appropriate compared to the plot because the plot shows a slight increase in salary as experience increases, but there are many datapoints for which that is not true.


c) Find the least-squares regression line to predict Y from X and draw it on a scatterplot of the data.

```{r}
plot(employees$educ, employees$salary, xlab="Education", ylab="salary")
abline(lm(employees$salary~employees$educ))
fit = lm(employees$salary~employees$educ)
summary(fit)
```

d) Find the 95% confidence interval for the slope coefficient.
```{r}
confint(fit)
```

e) Test at the 5% level to see if the slope is significantly different from 0. Interpret the result.
The p-value for the slope is 2e-16 which is much less than 0.05, therefore we must reject the null hypothessis that b1 (slope) = 0.
2) Over the three-day period from April 1 to April 3, 2015, a national poll surveyed 1500 American households to gauge their levels of discretionary spending. The question asked was how much the
respondent spent the day before; not counting the purchase of a home, motor vehicle, or normal
household bills. For these sampled households, the average amount spent was $95 with a standard
deviation of $185. Find a 95% confidence interval for the population average amount spent.

```{r}
install.packages("BSDA")
```
```{r}
library("BSDA")
```


```{r}
tsum.test(n.x=1500, mean.x=95, s.x=185)
```

3) A random sample of 85 group leaders, supervisors, and similar personnel revealed that a person spent an average 6.5 years on the job before being promoted with a standard deviation of 1.7 years. Using the 90% degree of confidence, what is the confidence interval for the population mean?

```{r}
tsum.test(n.x=85,mean.x=6.5,s.x=1.7,conf.level=0.9)
```

4) A polling service asked 2000 adults in Newark if they planned to buy a new car in the coming 12 months and 220 said yes. The same question asked of 3000 adults in Los Angeles returned 270 who answered yes. Test the two proportions are equal versus they differ at the 5% level of significance.

```{r}
prop.test(c(220,270),c(2000,3000),correct=FALSE)
```
The p-value is below 0.05 so we reject the null hypothesis and can state there is a difference between the two groups.

Answer true or false to the following statement and give a reason for your answer: If a 95% confidence interval for a population mean, Î¼, is from 33.8 to 39.0, the mean of the population must lie somewhere between 33.8 and 39.0.
False- we could be unlucky and 5% of the time we can get a sample that has a mean that doesnt fall into this range

6) Which of the following correctly describes the relationship between sample size and standard error of
the mean?
a) Increasing sample size increases standard error.
b) Increasing sample size decreases standard error.-> correct
c) Sample size and standard error are not related.

Suppose the US Department of Education is interested in knowing if the proportion of high school seniors planning on attending college is less than 0.60. They conduct a hypothesis test and get a p-value of 0.39. What interpretation should they make?
a) They reject Ho, and believe that proportion of high school seniors planning to attend college is less than 0.60.
b) They do not reject Ho, and conclude that the proportion of high school seniors planning to attend college is 0.60.
c) They reject Ho, and believe that the proportion of high school seniors planning to attend college is different than 0.60.
d) They reject Ho, and believe that the proportion of high school seniors planning to attend college is greater than 0.60.
e) They do not reject Ho, but cannot conclude that the proportion of high school seniors planning to attend college is 0.60. ->correct
