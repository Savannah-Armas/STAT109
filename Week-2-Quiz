#Which carrier has the highest number of flights?
table(flights$carrier)
# Answer:UA

#Number of flights in month 3 are:
sum(flights$month == 3)
# Answer: 28834

# TEST - Which origin airport has the maximum flights delayed with delay time more than 60 minutes.
flights %>% filter(dep_delay > 60)  %>% 
  group_by(origin) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count))
# Answer: EWR

flights %>% filter(dep_delay > 300, month == 1)  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=dep_delay, y=arr_delay)) +
  geom_point()

#How many flights have destination as ANC?
sum(flights$dest == 'ANC')
table(flights$dest)
# Answer: less than 200

#Which airline carrier shows possible outlier on a boxplot for distance?
flights %>% ggplot(aes(x=carrier, y=distance)) +
  geom_boxplot()
# Answer:AA

#Number of flights in month 10 are:
sum(flights$month == 10)
# Answer:28889

flights %>% ggplot(aes(x=origin, y=distance)) +
  geom_histogram()

flights %>% ggplot(aes(x=distance)) +

#Find standard deviation of dep_delay.
